It also aims to enable students to understand \\nand critically assess th e civic institutions that structure their local and global communities. To these ends, the course \\nwill examine the nature of ethics, its understanding across different cultures, and how it is manifested in concepts, \\nsocial structures, and governance instit utions.  \\n \\nTopics to be explored include human rights, democracy, freedom of speech  and inequality. The rights and duties of \\ncitizenship shall be a unifying theme. Students will think through assumptions they hold on all of these matters. \\nThey will be provided with the tools to understand various and even contradictory perspectives on these important \\nissues. There will be a substantial amount of time devoted toward understanding Singapore’s own institutions and \\nideologies, which are of course products specific to the country’s own unique historical and geo -political \\ncircumstances. We expect t hat students will have a better appreciation of the country’s institutions after reading \\nthe module.  \\n \\nINTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES  \\nBy the end of this course, you should be able to:  \\n1. Identify the morally relevant features of situations, decisions, and policies;  \\n2. Explain your moral responsibilities to actively participate in activities that strengthen your local and global \\ncommunities;  \\n3. Critically assess th e civic structures and institutions of your communities and your role in them;  \\n4. Make well -informed arguments on some major contemporary issues.  \\n5. Apply ethics and civics concepts to the Singapore context.  \\n \\nCOURSE CONTENT  \\n1. Introduction – What is Ethics, Civics, Multiculturalism and how is this relevant to you?  \\n2.

Results in a threat to social cohesion.iii.On the contrary, there is a sizeable societal and economic costassociated with such discrimination thus public policy and corporategovernance both have economic and ethical reasons to promote equalopportunities.iv.The World economic forum was set up to ensure this and has a similaragenda to the OECD.b.What is the WEF: The World Economic Forum is the InternationalOrganization for Public-Private Cooperation.
